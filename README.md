## 📖 About
CARE-AI is a Flutter mobile app for parents/caregivers and doctors/therapists to coordinate child support workflows. Parents can manage child profiles, run therapy activities and games, track progress, and use text/voice AI guidance. Doctors can review assigned patients, view activity history, assign plans, and send guidance notes. The app combines Firebase-backed data, local caching/offline support, scheduled reminders, and Gemini-powered assistance. It is focused on practical daily support, not medical diagnosis.

## 🧪 Testing

Current test status from repository files:
- Unit/integration-style tests present: **9 test cases** across `test/`
- Widget tests: present (`test/widget_test.dart`, 3 tests)
- Integration tests directory: not present

Run tests:
```bash
flutter test
flutter test --coverage
```

Note: In this environment, Flutter CLI was unavailable (`flutter: command not found`), so test pass/fail execution could not be re-verified here.

## 🐛 Known Issues

- [ ] Release signing artifacts are not fully configured in-repo (`android/key.properties` is absent; release signing depends on local setup).
- [ ] Account deletion only guarantees first-level subcollection cleanup; nested subcollections may remain (commented in `FirebaseService.deleteAccount`).
- [ ] Doctor request Accept/Decline actions in `doctor_requests_tab.dart` currently show snackbars and do not persist approval/decline updates.
- [ ] Voice assistant mute control in `voice_assistant_screen.dart` is UI-only; microphone chunk muting is not implemented in service logic.
- [ ] Placeholder TODO remains in Android config: `TODO: Specify your own unique Application ID`.

## 🗺 Roadmap

Based on current placeholders/incomplete behaviors:
- [ ] Wire doctor request decisions to backend (`respondToDoctorRequest`) in the requests tab UI.
- [ ] Implement true microphone mute path in `VoiceAssistantService`.
- [ ] Replace “opening soon” placeholders in About/Legal links with real destinations.
- [ ] Add complete release signing documentation and reproducible release setup files.
- [ ] Expand automated test coverage across feature screens/services.
- [ ] Add dedicated integration/e2e tests.
